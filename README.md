## R7- Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

As an avid basketballer myself, and with siblings and friends who have accepted sports scholarships from American colleges, I know all too well the disadvantages Australian basketballers face in gaining exposure to scouts and coaches, when compared with American basketballers. 'Athlead' aims to provide a platform for athletes to market themselves to scouts, advertising themselves with statistics and videos to allow for a potential scholarship offer. This removes the need for athletes to rely purely on personal connections and word of mouth, which yields often average results.

## R8 - Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Australian basketballers are at a significant disadvantage when it comes to exposure to college scouts and coaches. Australian talent is sought after to round out teams, but players and coaches alike have to rely on word of mouth and personal relationships to make the connections possible. There lies the need for something to bring the colleges and the players closer together, bringing more exposure to Australian athletes and in turn, more scholarship offers.

'Athlead' aims to provide a platform for Australian basketballers to market themselves and their talent to college scouts in America, allowing for easy access to athlete statistics and videos, and allows scouts to easily connect with athletes before offering a scholarship. A user can sign up as either a scout or an athlete, with scouts paying a fee to use the platform for that recruiting season. Athletes update their profile with their personal attributes such as height, weight and position, and their average game statistics. They can also embed videos and highlights showcasing their talent. Scouts can browse through athlete profiles, filtering by attributes to narrow results to what they require. Scouts can initialise conversations with athletes to discuss specifics of a potential scholarship offer. Once both parties are happy to move forward, a scholarship offer can be made to the athlete. An athlete can receive many offers, but can only accept one, and a scout can send as many offers as necessary.
